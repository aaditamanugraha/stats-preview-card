## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Using different background image for different size of screen (mobile and desktop).
- Blend the "background-image" with "--primary-soft-violet-accent" using "background-blend-mode" and "opacity".
- Using very nice and cool way to make a background image work like an img element so it adjust its height automatically. You need to know the image width and height ratio. Set the height of the container to 0 and set the padding-top as percentage based upon the image ratio.
